# EOSCON Website

A website built for managing the EOSCON event in the game Starbase.
This is still in very early stages, so many features may not function.

## Goals

- Event map (preferably 3D), integrated with lot information.
- Application management and lot allocation.
- Event timeline + support to allocate your own sub-events.
- Ship Catalog + Purchase information.
- Past EOSCON archives.

## Prerequisites

- Any standard Linux Distro that supports the following:
- BunJS >= 0.5.7 (See https://bun.sh/ for installation.)
- EdgeDB >= 2.9 (See https://www.edgedb.com/install for installation.)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository into a folder of choice.
2. Run the command `bun i` to install dependencies.
3. To start a development server, run `bun run dev`.
